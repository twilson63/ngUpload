# ngUpload

An AngularJS file upload directive.  


## Update 0.1.1

* ngUpload is now an AngularJS Directive, removing the need to deal with the form[@id] attribute.
* Addition of the __uploadOptionsEnableControls__ option to prevent the default disabling of submission controls during upload, like so:
``` html
<form ng-upload='callbackFunction' uploadOptionsEnableControls>
   ...
</form>
``` 
_Submission controls are html elements marked with the **upload-submit** css class_.
* Some bug fixes.

## Requirements

* AngularJS
* JQuery

## Usage

Add to your html file

```
<script src="/js/ng-upload.js"></script>
```

Create a basic form with a file input element

``` html
<div ng-app="app">
  <div ng-controller="mainCtrl">
   <form action="/uploads" ng-upload="results()"> 
     <input type="file" name="avatar"></input>
     <input type="submit" class="upload-submit" value="Upload"></input>
   </form>
 </div>
</div>
```

### Some rule of thumb

* Any html element that supports the click event can be used to submit the form marked with the __ng-upload__ directive, as long as such elements are marked with the 'upload-submit' class.
* The __()__ suffix on the __ng-upload__ directive callback function is optional.
* Make sure you import the __'ngUpload'__ module in your angularJS application.

Applying this rules, the sample above can be re-written as

``` html
<div ng-app="app">
  <div ng-controller="mainCtrl">
   <form action="/uploads" ng-upload="results"> 
     <input type="file" name="avatar"></input>
     <div class='upload-submit' style='cursor: pointer'>Upload with Div</div> &bull;
     <a class='upload-submit' href='javascript:void(0)'>Upload with Anchor</a>
   </form>
 </div>
</div>
```
where the form can be submit with a Div or Anchor html element.

The AngularJS controller for the above samples is given as:

``` js
angular.module('app', ['ngUpload'])
  .controller('mainCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.results = function(content, isCompleted) {
      if (isCompleted && content.length > 0)
        console.log(content); // process content
      else
      {
        // 1. ignore content and adjust your model to show/hide UI snippets; or
        // 2. show content as an _operation progress_ information
      }
    }
});
```
